## Introduction
My EDA will explore how the political environment influences terrorism trends.
As someone with enlisted friends and family who have worked in defense and for the military, I find this topic very interesting especially during a time when political tensions are extremely high and terrorist threats are a common topic in everyday news broadcasts. Since these two are obviously correlated, I want to analyze how and to what extent they influence each other.

I decided on using the Global Terrorism Database and the Polity IV dataset for my EDA as I found them comprehensive and included a variety of variables. The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is from Kaggle and is an open source database that has information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017 and is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at The University of Maryland. The Polity IV dataset is typically maintained by the Center for Systemic Peace (CSP). This dataset includes information on the world's political regimes.It assesses aspects like democracy, autocracy, and political stability. It provides numerical scores to categorize political regimes.
Both of them are maintained by official groups and are backed up by accredited organizations and have been widely used for research and are very comprehensive in their respected topics. These two datasets work well together to analyze the connections between the occurrence of terrorist attacks, weaponry, and different political regimes.

Some of the initial research questions revolved around political stability, weaponry, and the severity of attacks. I wondered how they were related and wondered how terms like "political stability" and "severity" could be formally defined and approached in a technical sense. Some specific questions were "How does the political stability of a country affect how likely a terrorist attack will be successful?" and "Does the type of weapon a terrorist chooses influence how likely they are to be succesful?" both of which I will explore in my EDA.

## Data overview & quality

The GTD dataset has 135 variables with 181,691 observations. There are 55 categorical variables and 75 numeric variables.The Polity dataset has 37 variables and 17,574 observations. There are 2 categorical variables and 35 numeric variables.

The first concern I had was that the Polity dataset was downloaded as a .sav file, which I ended up importing using the haven package. I did my data cleaning which included removing variables from both datasets that had significant missingness issue, in my case, over 50% missing. Since the earliest entry in the Polity dataset was 1776 and the latest entry in the GTD was 2017, I dropped any entries prior to 1776 from the GTD dataset and any entries after 2017 in the Polity dataset. I used the compound key "country_name" and "year" from the Polity dataset to join the two datasets and then cleaned up this new, combined dataset by removing any variables that I was not interested in working with and changed unknown values to "NA". This addressed my main concern of having too many variables and observations to work with. 

After I combined and cleaned my two raw datasets, the dataset I will be using for my EDA has 43 variables and very little missingness issues. This will prevent misrepresentations in my EDA and avoid any issues that arise with missing values. There are 11 categorical variables and 30 numerical variables with 175,790 observations. 

## General Overview of the Distribution of Terroist Attacks

In order to dive deeper into the relationships between politics and terrorism, it is important to first grasp an idea of the distribution of attacks over time, political regime types, and location.

#### Terrorist Attacks over Time

In order to understand the distribution of attacks over time, one must under how the frequency of terrorist attacks has changed from 1970 to 2017, which is visualized in the graph below.

<img src="figures/plot1.png" width="600" height="600">

Looking at this histogram, the distribution of terrorist attacks over time is skewed to the right, which means terrorist attack have become more common as time passes. It is interesting to note that terrorist attacks seem to have started decreasing after 1990 but increase drastically after 2001. It may be interesting to note that 2001 is when the United States of America launched an initiative called "The Global War on Terror" following the September 11 attacks on the twin towers which continues to this day.

#### Terrorist Attacks over Political Regime types

In order to analyze the distribution of attacks over political regime types one must answer if there more attacks if a country has a higher or a lower Polity score. A country's polity score is assigned based on how democratic or autocratic the governing bod is- a 10 means a country is strongly democratic and a -10 means a country is strongly autocratic. The distribution of attacks over Polity score is visualized in the graph below. 

<img src="figures/plot2.png" width="600" height="600">

This bar chart shows that most terrorist attacks do not happen in countries with a very low but instead tend to grow in number, with a sharp increase when the score is 6, following by a gradual decrease. Countries with Polity scores between 6 to 8 have the most terrorist attacks in total. Since very developed countries tend to have a very high polity score and very underdeveloped countries have a low polity score, these countries in the middle may be the ones that have several groups fighting for leadership and that don't have extremely advanced technology to defend themselves against attackers. These may also be the countries that developed countries use to fight proxy wars to protect the safety of those in the homeland. It is also interesting to note that the distribution is skewed to the right, meaning that most terrorist attacks happen in countries that are more democratic than not. Democracies tend to prioritize civil rights and the political freedom and may be more hesitant in suppressing and condemning radical groups. Radical groups may also feel safer conducting attacks in these countries as a means of drawing attention to their concerns while understanding that these countries may be more willing to negotiate for resolution. 

#### Terrorist Attacks over Geopolitical Areas

In order to understand the geopolitical distribution of terrorist attacks, one must see where most terrorist attacks occur. The table below shows the count of terrorist attacks within each region of the world. From this table, it is clear that the Middle East and South Asia suffer from the highest amounts of attacks.

In order to visualize this distribution, it is useful to consult a map tracking the amount of attacks per country as included below. 

<img src="figures/plot3.png" width="700" height="600">

Looking at the number of terrorist attacks by region and by country, it is evident that Middle Eastern/ North African countries and South Asian countries have a much higher attacked rate, which is supported by the data from the table. The regions with moderately high attack counts are South America and Sub-Saharan Africa.  This may be due to the fact that many countries in these areas have unstable political regimes and have several groups fighting for control of the government. It is interesting to note that the top four deadliest terrorist groups are located in the two regions that have the most attacks- Islamic State, al-Shbaab, Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen, and the Balochistan Liberation Army, meaning that these regions both launch and suffer the most attacks.

## Exploring Attack Success vs. Political Stability

The first major research question that drove my EDA was how does the political stability of a country affect how likely a terrorist attack will be successful.

In order to answer this, it is important to define what determines political stability and what determines a success. For this EDA, political stability will be measured by a country's durability and polity scores. Durability will be measured as the number of years since the most recent regime change- defined by a 3 point change in the Polity score over a period of three years or less. A country with a higher durability score and a higher Polity score will be regarded as more politically stable. A successful attack will be defined essentially it is defined as whether or not the attack type took place and is not judged in terms of the larger goals of the terrorists. 

#### Distribution of Successful and Unsuccessful Attacks

Before exploring the relationship between these variables, it is useful to have an understanding of the distribution of successful and unsuccessful attacks, shown in the figure below.

<img src="figures/plot4.png" width="600" height="600">

This bar chart shows that there are many more successful attacks than unsuccesful attacks. This is important to note as it means that countries are unable to counter terrorism to an ideal level and is a finding that needs to be taken seriously. This may be due to terror groups constantly evolving their tactics and taking advantage of technological advancements. Areas with improvements that may provide terrorists with significant advantages include modern communication, transportation, and weaponry. Unfortunately, this may also mean that terrorist attack may become more severe over time which I will touch upon in my second exploration. 

#### Relationship of Success Rate and Political Stability

In order to understand how the political stability of a country is related to the success rates of terrorist attacks within the country, one can compare the mean values of durable and Polity score for successful and unsuccessful attacks. 

This table will give an idea of whether there is a noticeable difference in political stability factors based on the outcome of the attacks
